// Challenges

// Create a class Hello in the App namespace. It should have a method called hello which accepts a string. Don't overthink this one! It's more about the namespaces than the class.

echo "\nQuestion 1:\n";

use App\Hello;

$sayHi = new Hello();

dump($sayHi->hello("Orb")); // "Hello Orb"
dump($sayHi->hello("Horse")); // "Hello Horse"

// Create a class Person in the App namespace. It should accept a first and last name on creation. It should have a sayHelloTo() method that takes another Person and says hello to them. Make sure your properties are all private: so you'll need to a create fullName() method too.

// Use the class as follows in your bootstrap.php:

echo "\nQuestion 2\n";

use App\Person;

$person1 = new Person("Lynne",  "Ramsay");
$person2 = new Person("Wes", "Anderson");

dump($person1->sayHelloTo($person2)); // "Hello Wes Anderson"
dump($person2->sayHelloTo($person1)); // "Hello Lynne Ramsay"
